A Framework for Using LLMs for Repository Mining Studies in Empirical Software Engineering,"Vincenzo De Martino, Joel Castaño, Fabio Palomba, Xavier Franch, Silverio Martínez-Fernández",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09974,"Context: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly transformed Software Engineering (SE) by providing innovative methods for analyzing software repositories. Objectives: Our objective is to establish a practical framework for future SE researchers needing to enhance the data collection and dataset while conducting software repository mining studies using LLMs. Method: This experience report shares insights from two previous repository mining studies, focusing on the methodologies used for creating, refining, and validating prompts that enhance the output of LLMs, particularly in the context of data collection in empirical studies. Results: Our research packages a framework, coined Prompt Refinement and Insights for Mining Empirical Software repositories (PRIMES), consisting of a checklist that can improve LLM usage performance, enhance output quality, and minimize errors through iterative processes and comparisons among different LLMs. We also emphasize the significance of reproducibility by implementing mechanisms for tracking model results. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that standardizing prompt engineering and using PRIMES can enhance the reliability and reproducibility of studies utilizing LLMs. Ultimately, this work calls for further research to address challenges like hallucinations, model biases, and cost-effectiveness in integrating LLMs into workflows.",2nd International Workshop on Methodological Issues with Empirical Studies in Software Engineering (WSESE 2025),2025
"Accelerating 3D Scene Development for the
Metaverse: Lessons from Photogrammetry and
Manual Modeling","Viviana Pentangelo, Dario Di Dario, Vincenzo De Martino, Marco Dello Buono, Stefano Lambiase",https://vipenti.github.io/assets/docs/iMeta_Accelerating.pdf,"The metaverse, a 3D immersive digital environment, is gaining significant interest due to its ability to connect people globally engaging and immersively, thanks to recent technological advancements. Developing high-quality 3D models is crucial for achieving realism and immersivity in the metaverse. However, this process is complex and resource-intensive, demanding specialized skills and substantial time. The emergence of novel automation tools and technologies, such as photogrammetry, which uses computer vision algorithms to reconstruct 3D models from 2D images, is beginning to address such challenges. Our research focused on analyzing the current state of such technologies in automating 3D scenes for the metaverse, comparing them to traditional manual modeling techniques. We conducted an experiment in which we built the same 3D scene using two techniques: a manual approach with Blender and a photogrammetry approach exploiting the Polycam tool on a mobile device. Our results have provided insights into the main strengths and limitations of using 3D automation techniques. The photogrammetry approach has significantly sped up the entire process, producing textures and models that accurately replicate real objects. However, it cannot wholly replace manual modeling approaches, without which it is impossible to obtain complete and efficient models. Lessons learned will serve as a foundation to guide developers in developing 3D scenes for the metaverse.",Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Metaverse Technologies & Applications (iMETA 2024),2024
